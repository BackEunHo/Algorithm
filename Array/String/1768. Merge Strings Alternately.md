1768. Merge Strings Alternately
Topics: String, Two Pointers, Easy

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string. Return the merged string.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `word1 = "abc"`, `word2 = "pqr"`
- **Output:** `"apbqcr"`
- **Explanation:** The merged string will be merged as so:
  ```
  word1:  a   b   c
  word2:    p   q   r
  merged: a p b q c r
  ```

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `word1 = "ab"`, `word2 = "pqrs"`
- **Output:** `"apbqrs"`
- **Explanation:** Notice that as `word2` is longer, `"rs"` is appended to the end.
  ```
  word1:  a   b 
  word2:    p   q   r   s
  merged: a p b q   r   s
  ```

### Example 3:
- **Input:** `word1 = "abcd"`, `word2 = "pq"`
- **Output:** `"apbqcd"`
- **Explanation:** Notice that as `word1` is longer, `"cd"` is appended to the end.
  ```
  word1:  a   b   c   d
  word2:    p   q 
  merged: a p b q c   d
  ```

### Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        int word1Length = word1.length();
        int word2Length = word2.length();
        int maxLength = (word1Length > word2Length) ? word1Length : word2Length;
        char[] word1Arr = word1.toCharArray();
        char[] word2Arr = word2.toCharArray();
        String result = "";
        for(int i = 0; i < maxLength; i++){
            if (i < word1Length){
                result += word1Arr[i];
            }
            if (i < word2Length){
                result += word2Arr[i];
            } 
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- Get the length of both strings.
  ```java
  int word1Length = word1.length();
  int word2Length = word2.length();
  ```
- Create a new string to store the result.
  ```java
  String result = "";
  ```
- Iterate through the strings and add the characters to the result string.
  ```java
  for(int i = 0; i < maxLength; i++){
    if (i < word1Length){
      result += word1Arr[i];
    }
  }
  ```
- If one string is longer than the other, we append the remaining characters to the result string.
  ```java
  if (i < word2Length){
    result += word2Arr[i];
  }
  ```
- Return the result string.
  ```java
  return result;
  ```

# 605. Can Place Flowers
Topics: `Array`, `Greedy`, `Easy`

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104
flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
0 <= n <= flowerbed.length

### Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        for(int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0) {
                boolean leftEmpty = (i == 0) || (flowerbed[i-1] == 0);
                boolean rightEmpty = (i == flowerbed.length-1) || (flowerbed[i+1] == 0);
                if (leftEmpty && rightEmpty) {
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    n--;
                }
                if (n == 0) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return n <= 0;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- Iterate through the flowerbed array.
```java
for(int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) 
```
- If the current plot is empty, check if the left and right plots are also empty.
```java
if (flowerbed[i] == 0) 
    boolean leftEmpty = (i == 0) || (flowerbed[i-1] == 0);
    boolean rightEmpty = (i == flowerbed.length-1) || (flowerbed[i+1] == 0);
```
- If both are empty, plant a flower and decrement n.
```java
if (leftEmpty && rightEmpty) {
    flowerbed[i] = 1;
    n--;
}
```
- If n reaches 0, return true.
```java
if (n == 0) {
    return true;
}
```
- If the loop completes and n is still greater than 0, return false.
```java
return n <= 0;
```
